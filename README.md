# Pathological-breast-cancer-model

In this notebook, I tried to build a machine learning model to classify an open source dataset, Breast cancer pathological features available at UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. 

You can see all the things from data manipulation and data cleaning to building and tuning the model from scratch. 

I used Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, and Tensorflow to make this model.

To understand each step, I provide some comments and also provide some links to documentation for better understanding.
You can build a model step by step, from loading the data to building the model.

**Hope you enjoy it.**
